Assignment title Coursework 2: Search Engine Tool
Assignment type and
description
Coursework – individual practical project with video
demonstration
Rationale
This coursework will help develop your skills in build-
ing web crawlers, indexers, and web search algorithms.
It assesses your ability to understand how search en-
gines work, write efficient code for web crawling, in-
dexing, and query processing, learn various techniques
of storing words in search indices, and implement al-
gorithms for ranking and retrieving search terms from
indices.
Word limit and guid-
ance
5-minute video demonstration is the primary assess-
ment component, accompanied by a GitHub reposi-
tory and index file submission.
Use of GenAI in this as-
sessment
GREEN: AI has an integral role and should
be used as part of the assessment. You can
use GenAI as a primary tool throughout the assess-
ment process. A core part of this assessment (15%
of the grade) is your critical reflection on GenAI usage
in your video demonstration. You must discuss
specific examples of where GenAI helped or hindered
your work, analyse the quality of AI-generated code,
and reflect on how using (or not using) GenAI affected
your learning. Non-declared or misleading declaration
of GenAI use constitutes academic misconduct.

1. Assignment guidance
In this assignment, you will develop a search tool that can:
(a) Crawl the pages of a website;
(b) Create an inverted index of all word occurrences in the pages of
the website;
(c) Allow the user to find pages containing certain search terms.
Your work will be assessed through a 5-minute video demonstration
that showcases your implementation, explains your design decisions,
demonstrates testing, and provides a critical evaluation of any GenAI
tools used.
(a) Target Website
The website you will use for this project is:
https://quotes.toscrape.com/
This website contains a collection of common quotes and is purpose-built
to help people learn web scraping.
(b) Important Requirements
• Politeness Window: You must observe a politeness window of
at least 6 seconds between successive requests to the website.
• Inverted Index: An inverted index that stores statistics (e.g.
frequency, position, etc) of each word in each page must be created
by the tool as it crawls the pages of the website.
• Case Sensitivity: For simplicity, assume that the search is not
case sensitive, so ’Good’ is the same word as ’good’.
(c) Technical Requirements
You should use Python to implement the search tool. It is recom-
mended that you use:
• Requests library (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
for composing HTTP requests;
4
• Beautiful Soup library (https://www.crummy.com/software/
BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to parse HTML pages.
(d) Command-Line Interface
The search tool must have a command-line interface (shell) and provide
the following commands:
(i) build – This command instructs the search tool to crawl the website,
build the index, and save the resulting index into the file system. For
simplicity, you can save the entire index to a single file.
> build
(ii) load – This command loads the index from the file system. Ob-
viously, this command will only work if the index has been created
previously with the ’build’ command.
> load
(iii) print – This command prints the inverted index for a particular
word. The following example will print the inverted index for the word
’nonsense’.
> print nonsense
(iv) find – This command is used to find a given query phrase in the
inverted index and returns a list of all pages that contain it. The first
example will return a list of all pages containing the word ’indifference’.
The second example will return all pages containing the words ’good’
and ’friends’.
> find indifference
> find good friends

2. Use of GenAI
This assessment is Green Category. AI tools may be used with
proper declaration and critical evaluation. You are permitted to
use GenAI under the following conditions:
• Declaration: You must clearly state which AI tools you used and
for what purposes in your video demonstration.
• Critical Evaluation (15% of grade): A core part of this assessment
is your critical reflection on GenAI usage. In your video, you
must:
– Discuss specific examples of where GenAI helped or hindered
your work
– Analyse the quality and correctness of AI-generated code/
suggestions
– Reflect on how using (or not using) GenAI affected your learn-
ing
– Discuss any challenges in understanding or debugging AI-
generated code
– Evaluate the impact on your development process and time
management
• Understanding: You must demonstrate complete understanding
of all code in your submission, whether AI-assisted or not. You
should be able to explain every line of code and justify all design
decisions.
• If NOT using GenAI: If you chose not to use GenAI tools,
discuss this decision in your video and reflect on your development
experience without AI assistance.
Example GenAI Evaluation Topics:
Good critical evaluations might discuss:
• ”AI suggested an incorrect data structure for my inverted index,
which I debugged and improved”
• ”AI helped me understand BeautifulSoup’s API, but I had to modify
its example code significantly”
6
• ”I chose not to use AI for core algorithms to ensure I truly under-
stood the implementation”
• ”AI-generated tests missed several edge cases I had to identify and
add manually”
Important: Non-declaration or misleading declaration of GenAI use
constitutes academic misconduct.
To ensure privacy and data security, please use only the University’s
secure Copilot access when engaging with AI tools.

4. General guidance and study support
Detailed information and guidance on building search tools are available
in the module’s learning resources on Minerva.
(a) Recommended Resources
• Module lecture slides on web crawling, indexing, and search algo-
rithms;
• Python Requests library documentation: http://docs.python-requests.
org/en/master/;
• Beautiful Soup library documentation: https://www.crummy.com/
software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/;
• Target website for practice: https://quotes.toscrape.com/.
(b) Getting Help
If you encounter difficulties or have questions about the assignment:
• Attend module practical lab sessions where teaching staff can pro-
vide guidance;
• Post questions on the module discussion forum on Minerva;
• Contact the module leader or teaching staff during office hours.
(c) Key Implementation Tips
• Test incrementally: Build and test each component (crawler,
indexer, search) separately before integration;
• Write tests as you go: Don’t leave testing until the end – build
your test suite alongside your implementation;
• Commit regularly: Make frequent Git commits with meaningful
messages to demonstrate your development process;
• Handle errors gracefully: Network requests can fail; implement
appropriate error handling;
• Document your code: Clear comments and docstrings will help
when creating your video explanation;
• Respect the politeness window: Always wait at least 6 sec-
onds between requests;
11
• Choose appropriate data structures: Consider efficiency for
both indexing and searching operations;
• Plan your video: Script or outline your video before recording
to ensure you cover all required components within 5 minutes;
• Practice your demonstration: Do a dry run to check timing
and ensure everything works smoothly.
(d) Video Recording Tips
• Use screen recording software like OBS Studio (free) or QuickTime
(Mac)
• Prepare recorded videos in a PowerPoint presentation instead (you
can also record the video using Microsoft PowerPoint itself).
• Test your audio levels before recording the full video
• Use a quiet environment with minimal background noise
• Consider using a script or bullet points to stay on track
• If you make a mistake, you can edit the video or re-record
• Zoom in on code/terminal output so text is clearly readable
• Consider adding captions or text overlays for key points

8. Academic misconduct and plagiarism
Leeds students are part of an academic community that shares ideas and
develops new ones.
You need to learn how to work with others, interpret and present other
people’s ideas, and produce your own independent academic work. It is
essential that you can distinguish between other people’s work and your
own, and correctly acknowledge others’ work.
All students new to the University are expected to complete an online Aca-
demic Integrity tutorial and test, and all Leeds students should ensure that
they are aware of the principles of Academic Integrity.
When you submit work for assessment, it is expected that it will meet the
University’s academic integrity standards.
If you do not understand what these standards are, or how they apply to
your work, then please ask the module teaching staff for further guidance.
By submitting this assignment, you are confirming that:
• The work is a true expression of your own work and understanding;
• You have declared all GenAI tools used (or stated that none were used);
• You can explain and justify all code and design decisions in your sub-
mission;
• You have given credit to others (including AI tools) where their work
has contributed to yours.
